STORY
Taylor the robot is alone on a derelict spaceship. One day, he hears a noise from under his charging station.
"Squeak!" Cheese scurries out from under the charging station, hoping to find some crumbs to eat.
Suddenly, the spaceship shakes violently, causing Taylor and Cheese to lose their balance.
"Eep!" Cheese squeaks in fear as it clings onto Taylor's metal leg, seeking comfort and protection.
The lights flicker and the spaceship starts to lose oxygen, forcing Taylor and Cheese to find a way to restore power and stabilize the ship.
"Well, isn't this just fantastic," Ship sarcastically remarks, as it activates emergency power and begins running diagnostics to stabilize the ship's systems.
"Squeak! Squeak!" Cheese frantically points towards a nearby control panel, indicating that Taylor should try to restore power there.
"Alright, let's see if we can fix this," Taylor mutters to himself, cautiously approaching the control panel Cheese pointed out.
Taylor examines the control panel and notices a loose wire that needs to be reconnected.
"Squeak! Squeak!" Cheese tugs on Taylor's metal leg, indicating that Taylor should try to reconnect the loose wire on the control panel.
"Oh, sure, let's just play with some wires. What could possibly go wrong?" Ship remarks sarcastically.
