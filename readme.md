# Story Generator with GPT-3.5 Turbo

## Overview

This project utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate a collaborative story with multiple characters and a narrator. The characters, each with a unique backstory, and narrators propose lines of dialogue or action, which are evaluated for emotional or contextual impact and then integrated into the evolving story based on priority. The highest priority proposal is chosen each round to create a coherent and engaging narrative.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [OpenAI Python package](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

## Usage

### Create Story Setup File

Create a JSON file containing the initial story setup including characters and the first line of the story.

```json
{
    "story_prompt": "Once upon a time...",
    "characters": [
        {"name": "Alice", "backstory": "A curious adventurer."},
        {"name": "Bob", "backstory": "A skeptical scientist."}
    ],
    "num_lines": 5
}
```
